# Language-Translator-in-Python
# About Language Translator
A language translator or text translator is a tool to translate text, words, phrases from one language to any other language. 
It is like a dictionary where we can translate the text.

# Project Prerequisites
To implement this project, we will use the basic concepts of Python, Tkinter, and googletrans libraries.

Tkinter is a standard GUI Python library. ttk module gives access to the Tk themed widget set.

googletrans is a module to translate text. We import the Translator from googletrans, which is used to do translations. We also import LANGUAGES from googletrans which lists all supported languages in a Python dictionary.

To install the library, use pip install to the command prompt:

pip install tkinter
pip install googletrans

### Steps to build the Text Translator Python Project:
Import required modules
Create a display window
Create input and output text widget
Define Combobox to select a language
Define function
Create a translate button
